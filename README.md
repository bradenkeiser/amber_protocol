# Amber Protocol for Complexed Protein Simulation and PBSA Evaluation 

This repository is for running a complexed simulation of a protein and its ligand. It uses the HMG-CoA Reductase docked with NAP and HMG as a reference example. The PDF instructions relate to running amber through job submission on a TARA HPC server. A plethora of files are available and utilized largely from a core 'qm_protocols' directory. These scripts encompass running parameterization of the complexed system, NVT and NPT equilibration, and production runs. In addition, there are a variety of scripts for running standard RMSD/RMSF analyses through python and/or R. Finally, there are methods for running a PBSA analysis using the MMPBSA.py program within Amber. 

These scripts require a large number of dependencies that were curated on the job submission server. While these protocols work 'out-of-the-box' on that system, they will likely need a series of tweaks in order to effectively run on non-specific HPCs or local environments. Nonetheless, I hope these serve as a strong springboard for those who may be struggling to fine-tune simulation runs and analysis strategies of complexed systems.
