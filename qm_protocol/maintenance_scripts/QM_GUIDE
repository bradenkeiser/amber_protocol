1) we obtained the combined structures

2) run the pt1_amber_protlig_param.sh
    this will go through Gaussian and gettting the resp charges

3) run protlig_em.sh
   this runs a minimization protocol on a non-solvated complex:
   protlig-nosolv.inpcrd and protlig-nosolv.prmtop
   these were generated with the tleap-qmbox.in where we have the setbox
   instead of solvatebox command to generate a PBC box without solvent

4) now, we should just need to run tleap again, but on the final output of the EM run
    making sure to source the previously generated lig.frcmod and lib files.
