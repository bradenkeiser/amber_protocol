this is the mutant parent folder: dimer_lig_hip741_protonated
this scripts makes amber inputs for ligand, protein with metal (Fe2+),
and an additional total complex with water and ions
it uses openbabel to properly add all hydrogens to ligand before
creating correct ligand topology files; it also renames the output.
the process will restart with deleting the alpha input folder
